## üîç Introduction  
The original project was a console-based Java application for collaborative farming. It handled user registrations, land listings, and basic farmer-company interaction via command-line I/O and internal data structures.

To improve usability, readability, and performance, I **refactored** the entire architecture into a modern **Android application** using **Java, XML layouts, and MySQL** as the backend database.

## üîÑ Refactoring Overview

| Original Component       | Refactored To                      | Impact on Readability              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Console-based UI         | Android XML Layouts                | Clear separation of UI and logic   |
| Java classes with `Scanner` | Android Activities and Fragments   | Modular, lifecycle-aware design    |
| In-memory user data      | Persistent storage via MySQL       | Real-time data access, permanent storage |
| Monolithic code logic    | Separated into adapters, models, and services | Easier to maintain and extend     |
| Manual navigation        | Android navigation components      | Smooth UI flow                     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Optimizations

| Feature/Module           | Before (Console App)               | After (Android App)                | Performance Impact                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| User input/output        | Blocking, linear flow              | Event-driven UI                    | Responsive UX                      |
| Data access              | Static HashMaps                    | Structured MySQL queries           | Persistent, scalable data access   |
| Repeated DB calls        | None                               | Optimized with query filtering     | Reduced load time                  |
| View rendering           | Not applicable                     | RecyclerView for dynamic lists     | Smooth scrolling and efficient UI |
| App architecture         | No separation of concerns          | MVC/MVVM-style modular structure   | Easier debugging and extension     |

## üß™ Before vs After Snapshot

### üìå Before: Console-based Registration (Java)
```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter farmer name:");
String name = sc.nextLine();
